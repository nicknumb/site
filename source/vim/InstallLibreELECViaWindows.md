## Boot from the SD card
As Khadas VIM support many different types of boot disk(SD card, USB-Disk and onboard eMMC storage), so it's needed to figure out one manually to boot up if there are more than two bootable media exist at the same time. Ways to boot from the bootable SD card you created aboved:

1. Long press the `Function` button to boot from SD card.(Need upgrade to the latest ROM first)
2. [Erase the eMMC](/vim/HowtoEraseEMMC.html) and Khadas VIM will boot from the SD card automately.
3. Force enter into [MaskRom mode](/vim/HowtoBootIntoUpgradeMode.html) first, then Khadas VIM will try to boot from SD card.

*Tips:*

* Make sure that the SD card is a bootable card and writed with the right disk image aboved.
* eMMC is the 1st boot disk for Khadas VIM, so if there are bootable ROM on eMMC, the hardware will boot from eMMC first.
* `Function` button mode: the hardware will boot from eMMC first, then switch to load the image/ROM on SD card via software approach.
