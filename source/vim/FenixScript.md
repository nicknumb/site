### Build image

And Fenix requires root privileges, you need to enter your password.
```sh
$ make
```

**NOTE:**If it’s your first time to build, the script will check your host PC environment 
and install some essential packages, and some repos(u-boot,linux) will be cloned 
automatically from Khadas GitHub.
