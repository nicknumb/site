title: Create a Bootable SD Card
---

Well, what is a bootable SD card?

* Bootable SD card is a SD card install the bootable bootloader on it.
* Bootable SD card is a boot disk and your target device boot from the SD card.

And why we need a bootable SD card?

* Bootable SD card can be used in the development, to speed up the process.
* If you wanna release ROM for SD card, Bootable SD card can be used in the development, 
* In some cases, when your target device can not boot and even fail to load the bootloader, you can use bootable SD card to do the recovery.


### Steps to get started
[Download](/vim/Firmware.html) or [build u-boot](/vim/BuildUboot.html) to get the bootloader blob for SD card.
No matter which way you take, you both need to keep in mind that there are different bootloader blobs for different boot disk/media:

* u-boot blob `u-boot.bin.sd.bin` is built for SD card
* u-boot blob `u-boot.bin` is built for eMMC storage

Pop the SD card into your PC, and make sure the disk is unmounted:
```sh
$ umount /dev/sdb1
```

Format the SD card as Fat32:
```sh
$ sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1 
```

Run `dd` to write the u-boot blob into the first sector of SD card:
```sh
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.bin.sd.bin of=/dev/sdb conv=fsync,notrunc bs=1 count=444
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.bin.sd.bin of=/dev/sdb conv=fsync,notrunc bs=512 skip=1 seek=1
```

Eject the SD card from PC:
```sh
$ sudo eject /dev/sdb
```

### Check it

Ensure that you have done the right [setup of Serial to USB module](/vim/SetupSerialTool.html).

In order to check the bootable SD card, you might also need to make sure that all the data stored in the onboard eMMC has been [wipe out](/vim/HowtoEraseEMMC.html).

Open a terminal type `kermit` command:
```
gouwa@Wesion:~$ kermit
Connecting to /dev/ttyUSB0, speed 115200
 Escape character: Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28, FS): enabled
Type the escape character followed by C to get back,
or followed by ? to see other options.

```

Insert the bootable SD card you create aboved into your target device and power it on, the printing should be like:
